1. yes im not sure if it should be merged across the whole table, and also i dont think you need to do the whole header filling for headers.maybe just merge the A1 to C1??
2. only Grand Total 2025 should be filled with colour, essentially only that cell where Grand Total 2025 is mentioned.
3. nope nothing has to be bold except for the bumbers in the total row, thats it, and also just the Grand Total 2025. 
4.  you could help me to freeze the columns A-C, thats it.
5. i was hoping to get help for the borders of the table. essentially i want the gridlines view to be off, and i want the table borders to look like the one u can see in the picture, is that possible? im attaching my current code :) but i hope you dont complicate the borders, thats my fear.
